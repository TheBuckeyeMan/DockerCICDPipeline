//This file is for providing an s3 client as well as the application
//So this portion will create a configuration to interact with the s3 bucket, without it, our application wouldnt beable to talk to our s3 bucket
//@Configuration defines this is a configuration class and it can define beans for spring context - aka, - the code here is for configuration,not nessasarily to do anything in particular
//@Bean indicates that this is a brean provider meaning it will return an instance of S3 Client that can be used elsewhere in the applicaiton.
